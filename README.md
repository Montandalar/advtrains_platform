# advtrains_platform
A mod that provides different types of platforms made out of various materials. 
This mod was originally made by Och_Noe, improved by Montandalar/Blockhead and now W3RQ01 is improving it quite substantially.
All the platforms have a crafting recipe, If you are in survival, you have to use a picaxe to break the platforms because: an acacia wood platform has only the textures of the acacia planks, for the rest (the shape and the sound) is of the default stonebrick platform that you can find in the Advtrains Mod.
